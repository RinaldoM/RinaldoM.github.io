            <p>
                Hi! My name is Rinaldo Menichetti and I'm very excited to be part of this adventure with you all.
                <br>What can I tell you about me? Let me think ... I'm 30years old (still can't believe it) and based in Oudsbergen (Limburg).
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2014 I graduated as an occupational therapist. It was a very interesting course and I learned a lot both professionally and personally.
                <br>After school I worked in a project on home adaptations for people with disabilities, but taking into account the principles of Universal Design.
                In my last job I worked for a non-profit organization where we supported the schools in achieving curriculum objectives.
            </p>

            <p>
                In my spare time I enjoy cooking, playing music, hiking and gaming.
            </p>

            <p>
                I always had an interest in programming. In september 2020 I started a course Java Development. 
                During the course I felt that I really enjoyed it so I decided to turn my career around and search for a job as a developer. So here we are!
